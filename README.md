NITC Authenticator
==================

A Firefox addon to automatically complete the Campus Networking Centre authentication. The username and password is to be entered just once inside the extension.

Usage
------------
You need the Add-on SDK from Mozilla to test Firefox Add-ons. Follow the instructions on [their website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials#getting-started) for more details.


Developers
----------
[Saneem](https://github.com/xaneem) and [Ajnas](https://github.com/ajnas).
We felt we were spending too much "productive" time on typing in the username and password and then clicking the login button. Why not automate it ;).

If you think something is missing, feel free to develop. We love pull requests.
